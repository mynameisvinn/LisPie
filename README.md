# lispy
an updated and heavily commented version of [norvig's lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy.html). it should be read in conjunction with [this](http://pythonpracticeprojects.com/lisp.html) and [this](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/) and [this](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter).

as for why this matters: "scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language."

## usage
to use, do `python lispy.py`.
```python
>>> python lispy.py
>>> (* (+ 2 3) 3)  # returns 15
```
